## Repo hygiene (Feb 18, 2026)
We accidentally edited/pushed an Afterlife deploy workflow to the `bertona88/wofi.ar` repo due to working in the wrong folder.

- Before changing workflows or pushing, confirm you’re in the right repo: `git rev-parse --show-toplevel` and `git remote -v`.
- This repo deploys Afterlife; workflow changes should land here (remote `bertona88/afterlife`).
